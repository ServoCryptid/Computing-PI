# Computing-PI
This repository contains the algorithm for computing the values of Pi based on Monte Carlo method.<br>
The algorithm is implemented in <b>OpenMP, MPI and CUDA</b>. 

The purpose is to test the weak and strong scaling of each one of them and find the proper configuration which gives the best results. 

The algorithms were tested on Virtual Machines created on the Google Cloud Platform.  

This was part of the laboratories for Big Data Technologies lecture at the West University of Timisoara, first year, semester two of Big Data - Data Science, Analytics and Technologies masters.
